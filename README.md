# anking_graph

Create a network graph of the AnKing deck based on user-created tags. Lots of interesting clusters, but it's pretty crowded. Used a spring layout, could work better with a different format:

The graph works, but I dropped the project and never made it pretty because I was about to take Step 1 and never wanted to see Anki or Anking ever again.
